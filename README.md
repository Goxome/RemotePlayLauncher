# 🎮 Remote Play Launcher

**Remote Play Launcher** is a lightweight desktop tool that lets you play **non-Steam games using Steam’s Remote Play Together**.

It acts as a fast, minimal launcher that helps you bring any local game into your Remote Play workflow — without the usual friction.

## ✨ What It Does

- 🕹️ Launch non-Steam games through Steam Remote Play Together  
- ⚡ Provides a fast, distraction-free launcher  
- 🎯 Simplifies couch co-op with unsupported games  
- 🖥️ Supports borderless fullscreen for seamless streaming

- Play local multiplayer games remotely  
- Stream unsupported titles to friends  
- Build a clean couch-gaming setup  
- Avoid Steam overlay interruptions
